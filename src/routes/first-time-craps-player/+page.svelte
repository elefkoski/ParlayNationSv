				“I’ve always wanted to learn how to play Craps.” is a phrase I’ve heard 10,000 times. You’ve
				watched the crowd explode with excitement, and you want to be a part of it; you want to have
				fun too! Then you look at the layout and think, “Maybe next time.” While a lot is going on,
				you don’t need to be concerned with the majority of it. If you stay focused on a select few
				bets, you can have loads of fun, never knowing the rest.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>The Pass Line – </span>Bet the table minimum on <Link
						text="the Pass Line"
						href="pass-line-basics"
					/>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Odds on the Pass Line – </span>Anything more you want to bet should be used as Odds
					(an extra bet added behind your Pass Line).
				</li>
				<li><span>Place bets on the 6 or 8 – </span>Two very common and good bets on the table.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				That’s it; you can play all night with a handful of bets. After that, expand your knowledge
				one bet at a time as you get comfortable. One of the best parts about Craps is how much the
				dealers help. Just ask, 'Could you recommend some bets?' and the dealers will guide you
				through. There's no need to stress over the details like payouts or chip placement. Simply
				listen to their instructions, and when you hear “That’s your money!”, scoop it up quickly!

		<BlogH2 id="dealerAdvice" title="Follow the Advice of the Dealers">
			<p class="pb-4">
				The dealers have a vested interest in you winning money. If you’re making bad bets and
				losing lots of money, it’s hard for the dealers to earn tips. We want you to win, so when we
				offer a suggestion, it’s for all of our benefits.
			</p>
			<p>Here are some of the most common tips from dealers.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Bet more on the Odds, not the Pass Line - </span>I know you’re trying to win more by
					betting more but we’re in this for the long haul. Betting big on the Pass Line could make
					some quick dough when winners roll on <Link text="the Comeout" href="the-stages" />, but
					even money is for the birds. You will make more money waiting for a Point and betting more
					as Odds.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Make sure you have proper Odds - </span>You may only lose 40 or 50 cents when you
					bet improper Odds, but it all adds up. Pennies turn into dollars, and a single dollar can
					quickly turn your day around.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Buy the 4 & 10 - </span>When you get to a $20 Place bet on the 4 or 10, it’s highly
					recommended that you BUY it. That means paying a commission to get paid 2:1 instead of
					9:5. Place bets on the 4 and 10 are much worse than <Link
						text="BUYs on the 4 and 10"
						href="buying-place-bets"
					/>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Press some bets - </span>The dealers have seen enough bad rolls to be able to
					appreciate a good one when we see it. That’s why it pains us when a player stays at the
					table minimum the whole time. Even slowly pressing can result in huge gains. If the dealer
					says something like, “You may want to bump your bet up a little.” Maybe you should listen.
				</li>

		<BlogH2 id="notJustOk" title="Don't Just Say OK">
			<p class="pb-4">
				A common experience for many players is this: they listen carefully to the dealers, and
				respond with an 'Ok,' but still find themselves confused about what's happening. This is a
				normal part of the learning process and nothing to worry about. You may not be able to
				retain everything they told you in that moment but you can use strategies to help you
				process the information; one being to repeat the dealer's instructions back to them after
				you say ‘Ok’ which can significantly help in remembering the rules.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, you may be reluctant to ask the dealer to repeat themselves but remember, that's part
				of our job. Feel free to ask for clarifications. Craps is much more fun when you understand
				what is going on so don’t pretend to know; it only leads to confusion. Dealers are good at
				recognizing when a player understands the game – if you're not celebrating when the Point
				rolls, or if <Link text="your Odds" href="pass-line-odds" /> are incorrect, we know you didn’t
				get it yet.
			</p>

		<BlogH2 id="lotsOfQuestions" title="Ask Lots of Questions">
			<p class="pb-4">
				This is imperative. There is too much going on for you to know it all, and the dealers are
				there to help, so take advantage of them. If you see the base dealer is busy helping other
				players, ask the stickperson. If they are busy, you can always resort to the boxperson or
				the floor supervisor whose job is also to help everyone. If you know you will be asking lots
				of questions, you may want to pick a spot at the table next to the dealer so you can have
				conversations without having to talk past other players.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also ask the players next to you. Most players are willing to help but, be careful,
				some players only pretend to know what they’re talking about. If you’re unsure whether the
				information is correct, take a glance at the dealers while they are explaining the game to
				you; they are always listening and will be able to respond to your glance with nods of
				approval or some side-eye glances of disapproval.

			<p>
				In Craps, knowing the rules is just the start. You're facing dozens of bets, each paying
				something different and having its own order of operation. You don’t want to learn it all.
				It’s overwhelming if you let it be, and honestly, even a genius would struggle to grasp it
				all in one go. The key? Focus on learning bit by bit. Tackle one bet at a time, one payout
				at a time, and don’t worry about the order; that’s the dealers’ job.

				It's a simple piece of advice that many players miss: get familiar with Craps before you
				start playing. Learning as you go can be fun, but knowing the basics in advance makes
				everything easier. Have time to spare? My website is filled with information. Need a quick
				fix? Check out the guide I’ve created. If you're already at the casino, find a calm spot, do
				some quick reading, and then approach the table.

				As you wrap up this beginner's guide, keep in mind that Craps is a game of patience,
				practice, and participation. Don’t rush your learning curve. Start with the basics, lean on
				the knowledge of dealers, and slowly expand your skillset.
			</p>
			<p>
				Above all, remember that Craps is meant to be fun. Whether you're <Link
					text="rolling the dice"
					href="better-craps-shooter"
				/> or placing bets, each moment at the table is a chance to learn, interact, and maybe even win.
				So take a deep breath, join the table, and let the good times roll!
