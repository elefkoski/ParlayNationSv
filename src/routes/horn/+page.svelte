			A Horn pays differently based on what rolls, a high number, which would be the Aces and the

		</p>

			No matter which of the four bets hit, you always take what the winning bet paid and subtract
			the rest of the losers in order to keep the whole bet up to win again.

		<p class="pb-4">
			If either low side hits, the Ace Deuce or Yo, it would win $15 but then you would subtract the

		<p class="pb-4">
			When a bet on the Horn comes in for the dealers it is placed in the middle of the Horn area.
			While a proper $4 would be best, any amount put on the Horn for the dealers is appreciated. A
			good easy way to bet for the dealers on the Horn is to throw in a nickel and say <Quote
				text="Two-way Horn!"
			/>. That will give you a $4 Horn and $1 for the dealers.
