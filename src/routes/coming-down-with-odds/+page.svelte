			If you're playing both Come bets and Place bets, you will have times when the Come bet will
			move into the number that your Place bet is on. Since betting both would be redundant and Odds
			pay better than Place bets, you're going to want to take down the Place bet and use it as Odds
			for the Come bet. The act of using your Place bet and/or its' payment as Odds is called
			'Coming Down with Odds'.

			It takes both a <Link text="Place Bet" href="place-bet-basics" /> and a <Link
				text="Come Bet"
				href="come-bet-basics"
			/> in order to Come Down w/Odds. If you're playing both Come bets and Place bets then you should
			expect to be Coming Down w/Odds and you should be thinking about how many Odds you'll be coming
			down with.
