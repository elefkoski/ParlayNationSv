				One of the best things I’ve seen in my Craps career was seeing a player turn $10 into
				$10,000 in a matter of minutes using a single bet, “Ten dollar hard eight” and one word,
				twice, “Parlay”.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				This guy took a <Link text="$10 Hard Eight" href="the-hardways" />, parlayed it to $100 Hard
				Eight, parlayed it again to a $1,000 Hard Eight, then actually hit it at $1,000 for a $9,000
				payment. The guy took his payment. He took his $1,000 bet down and ended up walking away
				with $10,000 — in five minutes… from $10.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. While <Link
					text="proposition bets"
					href="proposition-bets"
				/> do offer some instant gratification and low minimums, they can quickly turn into a costly
				endeavor if you’re not paying attention to how much you’re betting. This guide will teach you
				how to strike a balance between quick wins and long-term strategies.

			<p>
				“Parlay” is by far my favorite word in Craps. You can turn $10 into $10,000 in a matter of
				minutes. This website is named after this move because I love it so much. Is it hard to hit
				parlays? Yes, but when they hit you get paid huge amounts for a tiny investment.

		<BlogH2 id="payMost" title="They Pay the Most">
			<p>
				Proposition bets pay the most because most of them are one-roll bets. With the exception of
				Hardways, if you don’t win on the next roll you’ll lose your bet. Some other Prop bets last
				longer than one roll like the All, Tall, Small, and the Fire Bet but you won’t find those on
				most Craps tables.

		<BlogH2 id="noWait" title="No Waiting to Get Paid">
			<p>
				Since most Prop bets are <Link text="one-roll bets" href="proposition-basics" /> they get resolved
				instantly. For this reason, you don’t need to wait for a bunch of rolls to go by before you get
				paid. As soon as the dice land you either lost or you’re getting paid. Instant gratification.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="lowerLimits" title="Lower Table Limits">
			<p>
				One of the best features of Proposition bets is the fact that the table minimum doesn’t
				apply to them. Bets in the middle are $1 minimum. When you’re betting a Prop that includes
				multiple numbers the minimum may rise like the<Link text=" C & E" href="c-and-e" /> which is
				a $2 min, the Horn with a $4 min, and the <Link text="Horn High" href="horn-high" />/<Link
					text="World
				"
					href="world"
				/>which has a $5 min.

		<BlogH2 id="throwingBets" title="Throwing Bets to the Stickperson">
			<p>
				When you bet a Prop bet you are supposed to throw your chips to the stickperson who will
				then set up your bet. Being able to throw your bet is the fun in my eyes, like playing catch
				when you were younger. Many players are scared as they should be because they are horrible
				at tossing even one chip but don’t fear; make eye contact with the stickperson then do your
				best to get all the chips to them.

				When you’re making bets all over the table you’re chances of getting paid on any given roll
				are increased. Will it be enough to cover the losses of the other bets? Let’s hope so.
				Sometimes though, you won’t have other losses. Sometimes you’ll have other wins and now
				you’re getting paid two, three, four, maybe even five times in a single roll.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Imagine you got a Point of 10. You’re sitting with a <Link
					text="Pass Line bet"
					href="pass-line-basics"
				/> with Max Odds. You want to bet more on the 10 but you’re at <Link
					text="Max Odds"
					href="max-odds"
				/> so you double dip by making a Place bet on the 10. At the same time you want a Hard 10 and
				for some reason, you have a feeling the Field is going to come in so, you bet that as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the next roll comes 5-5 for the Hard 10 then you, my friend, are getting paid and paid
				and paid and paid and paid again.

				Proposition bets at the Craps table offer high-risk, high-reward opportunities that can
				instantly start filling the rail. These bets offer the allure of instant payouts and lower
				table minimums, making them both accessible and fun. However, it's crucial to remember that
				while these bets may pay off big in the short term, their long-term profitability is
				questionable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you're a seasoned player or<Link text=" a newbie" href="first-time-player" />,
				consider adding some Prop bets to your strategy for that extra thrill. But remember,
				moderation is key. Don't let the allure of quick riches cloud your judgment, but you should
				also go with your gut. If you feel it, go for it. Just don’t feel it all the time.
