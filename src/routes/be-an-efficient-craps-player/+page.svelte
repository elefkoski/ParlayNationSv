				When it's time to make your bet, you must be ready, as you're always racing against the next
				dice toss. Anticipate your next move and plan ahead to ensure a smooth process.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Puck Off - </span>As soon as <Link text="the puck" href="the-craps-table" /> is turned
					off, promptly place your Pass Line or Don't Pass bets. If you win, collect your winnings. If
					you're a Prop Comeout Roll bettor, have that bet ready. Consider hedging and prepare the necessary
					amount in your mind.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Puck On - </span>Once a Point is established, you may have multiple bets to make.
					Mentally line them up in your head. Start with placing Odds, followed by making Place or
					Come bets, betting on <Link text="Hardways" href="the-hardways" />, and then proceeding to
					the rest of your Proposition bets.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Intermediate Rolls - </span>During intermediate rolls, focus on coming back on
					repeatedly losing bets, such as Hardways, Come & Don't Come, and potentially <Link
						text="the Field"
						href="the-field"
					/>. Determine the appropriate amount for Odds and Lay Odds for Come and Don't Come bets
					before the dice reach their respective numbers.

				Efficient betting involves being able to place your bets without relying on the dealer to
				fix them for you. By getting it right the first time, you allow the dealers to concentrate
				on maintaining the flow of the game.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Largest Denomination Cheques on Bottom - </span>Arrange your cheques in descending
					order, with the largest denomination at the bottom. For example, if your bet totals $36,
					place the quarter ($25) at the bottom, followed by two nickels ($5 each) in the middle,
					and the dollar ($1) on top. Cheques not in the correct order will need to be rearranged by
					the dealer.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Chunking Cheques - </span>This is when youâ€™re putting a tower in the field.
					Sometimes it will be full of all different denominations causing the dealer to have to
					break down your bet and pay you in larger denominations. This is a good time to start
					betting in higher denominations, as it provides clarity about your bet amount and reduces
					the time spent by the dealer in breaking it down.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Proper Odds - </span>Ensure you bet the correct amount of Odds for your Pass Line
					bets. Multiples of $5 are suitable for the 6 and 8, any even amount for the 5 and 9, and
					any amount for the 4 and 10. If you bet improper Odds, the dealer will correct it or
					explain why it's incorrect so you can adjust it accordingly. Avoid wasting time due to
					incorrect bets.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Provide Adequate Space - </span>Leave enough space between <Link
						text="your Odds"
						href="pass-line-odds"
					/> and Pass Line bet for the dice to land. Inadequate spacing often leads to time-consuming
					separations of bets. Creating sufficient space helps maintain the game's flow.

				Placing bets with the dealer can be more complex. Let's focus on efficient strategies for
				making change and placing multiple bets.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Know Proper Bet Amounts - </span>Save time by providing the exact amount of money
					needed for a bet. Instead of giving extra money and expecting change, give the exact
					amount required. For example, if you want to bet <Link text="$32 Inside" href="inside" />,
					provide $32 rather than giving more and expecting change back.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Overbet and Get Change - </span>You don't need to break down large-denomination
					cheques into smaller ones. Instead, communicate your desired bet amount and the dealer
					will give you the appropriate change. For instance, if you give the dealer a quarter and
					ask for $12 on the 6, the dealer will provide $13 in change. This approach reduces
					unnecessary actions and speeds up the game.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Betting Multiple Numbers Separately - </span>Rather than asking for one bet at a
					time, use the term "each" to efficiently place multiple bets with the same amount. For
					example:
					<ul>
						<li>"$12 each on the 6 & 8"</li>
						<li>"$1 each on the Hard 6 & 8"</li>
						<li>"$3 each on <Link text="C & E" href="c-and-e" />"</li>
						<li>"$50 each on the 4 & 10"</li>
						<li>"$2 each on a <Link text="three-way craps" href="multi-bets" />"</li>
						<li>"$5 each on High Low"</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Use "High on the..." - </span>This phrase is useful for splitting uneven bet
					amounts, particularly for proposition bets. For example:
					<ul>
						<li>"$25 on all the hardways, high on the 4" (placing $10 on the 4)</li>
						<li>"$10 on a three-way craps, high on the twelve" (placing $4 on the 12)</li>
						<li>"$5 on High Low, high on the Low" (placing $3 on the Aces)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Use Spread Bets - </span>When betting on more than two Place bets for the same unit
					amount, employ Spread bets. Options include <Link text="Across" href="across" />, <Link
						text="Inside"
						href="inside"
					/>, <Link text="Outside" href="outside" />, <Link text="Uptown" href="uptown-downtown" />,
					<Link text="Downtown" href="uptown-downtown" />, and <Link
						text="Including the Point"
						href="including-the-point"
					/>. These bets streamline the process of betting on multiple numbers simultaneously.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Be Specific when Splitting Amounts - </span>Avoid confusion and unnecessary
					conversation by being specific when splitting bets. For example, instead of saying, "Gimme
					the hard six and eight" while throwing a nickel, specify "Three dollars on the hard six
					and two dollars on the hard eight." Clear instructions facilitate a smoother betting
					experience.
