				Not all Craps tables are created equal. Each is its own staging ground where every person at

			<p class="pb-4">
				Your money is going to last the longest if you play a Craps table with the lowest minimum.
				If you can find a $5 Craps table, you can stretch a couple hundred a long way while being
				able to play a variety of bets at once. If you increase that minimum to $15, a $200 buy-in
				severely limits how many bets you can play together without <Link
					text="killing your bankroll"
					href="managing-craps-bankroll"
				/>.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				When you start getting into higher limits like $25 tables, the minimums for <Link
					text="Proposition bets"
					href="proposition-bets"
				/>
				change from $1 to $5, making a bet like the Horn a $20 minimum instead of $4. If you’re playing
				a quarter game, a buy-in of at least $500, but closer to $800 or $1,000, is my recommendation.
				If you buy in for $300, you’ll want to limit yourself to one or two bets, otherwise, betting
				a multitude of bets will result in a five minute visit to the Craps table if things go South.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, regardless of the table limit, Odds for the Pass Line and for Odds for Come bets
				will always be $1 minimum on the 4 & 10, $2 minimum on the 5 & 9, and $5 minimum on the 6 &
				8.

			<p class="pb-4">
				Scan the rails to assess the situation.The quickest way to assess the situation is to scan
				the rails. Do you see nice and healthy rows of chips in front of the players? It looks like
				they’re doing well. If there’s no money in the rails, it’s safe to assume the table was less
				than par.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				The denomination of the chips are important as well. $300 can be 60 red chips, 12 green
				chips, or three black chips. $100 in green is only half an inch. A stack is 20 chips and
				about the width of a cell phone, which in red is $100.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				The rail can be deceiving because there is the possibility that everyone has just walked up.
				One person deciding to shoot alone will attract other players to the game, many of them in
				large groups. Where there were zero players two min ago, there are a dozen players now.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do you see one player with a mountain of chips, while the rest have nothing special? I guess
				that was the last remaining player from <Link
					text="a great roll"
					href="a-great-craps-roll"
				/> where everyone else colored up and left. It happens all the time that players will color up
				after a great roll. A few will last a few more rolls, then leave, and very often one person will
				stay and play no matter what. The remaining players, with modest chip piles, were either late
				to the party or are new players.

			<p class="pb-4">
				What kind of players are at the table? The people you stand shoulder to shoulder with will
				have an enormous effect on the experience. Do you see a table full of grumpy old guys? Maybe
				skip it; it can be a struggle to get them all loosened up. Finding a bachelor or
				bachelorette party is always fun. Groups wearing the same outfit and groups for birthdays
				are usually fun. People are more comfortable with their friends, so they let loose a bit
				more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scan the people’s faces as well. You can instantly tell who’s having a good time and who
				isn’t. Watch out for the really drunk ones as well. They can be fun, but more often than
				not, they are just annoying and cause <Link
					text="more problems"
					href="not-to-do-at-craps-table"
				/> than needed.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="theLayout" title="Scan the Layout">
			<p class="pb-4">
				What you see on the layout is going to have a huge impact on the pace of the game. You can
				walk up to a packed table and scan the layout to find nobody is betting much—nothing more
				than the Pass Line and maybe a number. No Field bets, no Come bets, and no Proposition bets
				are being thrown around. With nobody betting, we don’t have to stop the dice. This game will
				move fast.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				The table next door can have three or four players per side and non-stop action. These
				players are using Spread bets, doing presses, betting Props every roll, and giving the
				dealers a workout. This game would probably move slower than the packed table.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even a few players betting too many Proposition bets will turn a Craps table into molasses.
				If you see the middle of a Craps table packed with bets and watch the players constantly
				raining in bets, you may want to continue walking. Those players will only destroy the pace
				of the game while whittling away their bankroll.

			<BlogH3 title="The Experienced Dealer">
				<p class="pb-4">
					The experienced dealers will be able to service everyone, pay everything correctly, handle
					the crowd, and move the dice in a timely manner. They stop the shenanigans before they get
					out of hand.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					When they do their job, they make it look easy. They move fast and efficiently. These are
					the dealers who look comfortable and confident. They don’t second guess their decisions or
					lean on others to solve minor problems. They know what the players are going to do before
					the players do.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					A table full of experienced dealers can maintain an unbroken pace throughout the game. The
					game becomes like gears in a clock, everything moving perfectly. The players and dealers
					are in sync, and we must only keep the dice moving. That is what we strive for.
				</p>
			</BlogH3>
			<BlogH3 title="The Inexperienced Dealer">
				<p class="pb-4">
					Have you ever seen a dealer constantly staring down at the layout? That would be the
					inexperienced dealer wondering what’s going on. Not able to handle everything
					instinctively, they must prepare for what’s about to happen. And the only time they have
					to figure it out is in-between each roll, when they stare at the layout performing
					mental-gymnastics until they which way is up.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					Also, claiming they’re capable of top-notch customer service might be a stretch. Offering
					friendly chatter or giving lessons to players is hard when you’re stuck in you’re head
					trying to figure out what something pays, the order it’s paid in, the procedure to follow,
					or a myriad of other thoughts required to get through the next roll.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					When it comes to disputes with players, a novice dealer is wrong more than I’d like to
					admit. You need to be patient even though they are making mistakes – they are learning.
					Every mistake can be fixed but rattling a new dealer can send them down a spiral they may
					not recover from. Sadly, I’ve watched dealers break down in tears from the pressure
					applied by, not only the game, but from players leaning on their mistakes. Do not be that
					person.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					It’ll take a couple of years for a new Craps dealer to nail everything down. Some dealers
					will struggle for many more years dreading every time they get put not the game. Even now,
					I work with at 10+yr veteran Craps dealers who still doesn’t get it.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’re fortunate the Craps table comes with a crew. You can have the boxperson helping the
					dealer get through the process while the stickperson helps the players. You also have the
					option to move to the other side of the table where, hopefully, an experienced dealer
					resides.

				Choosing the right Craps table involves more than just walking up to the nearest one; it
				sets the stage for your entire experience. Table limits, the rail, the crowd, and the layout
				all offer clues to what you can expect. An experienced dealer can make your Craps experience
				seamless, while a newbie can turn it into a confusing ordeal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Armed with these insights, your next course of action is to assess the situation before you
				step up to the rail. Take a moment to scan the table and the crowd, and weigh these factors
				to make an educated choice for a satisfying Craps experience.
