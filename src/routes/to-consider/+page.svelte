			There are more ways to bet in Craps besides picking bets. Some are good, and some are bad. You
			may accidentally leave money from a winning bet on the table, or you may want to bet with the
			dealers or the shooter. Here are some other Craps nuances you'll want to consider.

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Craps Bets Are Self Service?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			A self-service bet is a bet that is taken care of by the player, not the dealers. You gotta
			keep an eye on your own bets and not forget to pick up your winnings. If you forget whether a
			bet is yours, don't be afraid to ask the player next to you. Normally they will tell the truth
			out of fear of being called out by the dealers if they lie. The self-service bets are the Pass
			Line and Odds, the <Link text="Don't Pass" href="dont-pass" /> and its <Link
				text="Lay Odds"
				href="dont-pass-lay-odds"
			/>, the <Link text="Come Bet" href="come-bet-basics" />, the <Link
				text="Don't Come"
				href="dont-come"
			/>, and <Link text="the Field" href="the-field" />. All other bets on the table are taken care
			of by the dealers.

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Does &ldquo;If it Lays it Plays&rdquo; Mean in Craps?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			When you hear a dealer say, <Quote text="If it lays, it plays." /> they are telling someone that
			they have won a self-service bet but haven't picked up their winnings. If a roll goes by without
			that player picking up their money, then it will be added to the original bet regardless of whether
			the player wanted it or not.

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What is String Betting at a Craps Table?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Imagine going to the bar and ordering a drink, and when they come back with your drink, you
			order another drink, and when they come back with that one, you order a third, and yes, when
			they come back with that drink, you order a fourth. I guarantee the next time the bartender
			sees you, they'll turn their head. String Betting is when you make one bet, then another, then
			anotherâ€¦ etc. It's making the dealer go back and forth repeatedly. Learn <Link
				text="Spread Bets"
				href="spread-bets"
			/> so you can make multiple bets simultaneously or know what you want before you start handing
			the dealer money and tell them all at once.
		</p>
		<Divider />
		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Is a Two Way Bet in Craps?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Since most players don't bet for the dealers without making a bet themselves, we have a phrase
			<Quote text="Two way." /> When you make a Two Way bet, you are: betting for yourself and the dealer
			simultaneously, on the same bet, and is generally used for <Link
				text="Proposition Bets"
				href="proposition-basics"
			/>.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4">
			You could throw in a couple of dollars and say, <Quote text="Two-way Hard 10" />, and the
			dealer would know you are betting one of those cheques for you and the other for the dealers.
			If you throw in two cheques that are a different amount, let's say a nickel and a dollar, the
			dealer will know the larger amount is for you, and the lessor is for the dealers. You could
			also say
			<Quote text="Five and one on the Hard 10" />, five for you and one for them on the Hard 10.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4">
			No matter how much money you bet, the dealers will always be highly appreciative of the
			gesture.

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Is a Three Way Bet in Craps?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Sometimes a player would like to thank the shooter for having a good roll or possibly invoking
			them to roll a certain number. This is where the Three-Way bet comes into play. It is a bet
			for themselves, the dealers, and the shooter. It's unorthodox to bet only for yourself and the
			shooter because the dealer is the one servicing both people. E.g., if you throw $3 to <Link
				text="the
		stickperson"
				href="the-crew"
			/>, you would say <Quote text="Three-Way Aces" />, meaning $1 on <Link
				text="Aces"
				href="straight-up"
			/> for each the shooter, the dealers, and yourself.

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Does it Mean to Hedge Your Bets at the Craps Table?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Hedging is insurance. It's making a bet that wins when another bet loses. A common hedge bet
			is the <Link text="Any Craps" href="any-craps" /> when you're betting the <Link
				text="Pass Line"
				href="pass-line-basics"
			/>. The Pass Line loses during the Comeout Roll when a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled, and the Any
			Craps wins when the 2, 3, or 12 rolls. To protect a $5 Pass Line bet, you would bet $1 on the
			Any Craps. If a crap rolls, the $5 Pass Line would lose but, you would win $7 for your $1 Any
			Craps, which covers your loss.
