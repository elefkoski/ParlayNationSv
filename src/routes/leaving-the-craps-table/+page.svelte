				You've mastered the game rules, you know how to bet, but do you know when to walk away? The
				question isn't as simple as it seems. Whether it's <Link
					text="hitting your goal"
					href="managing-craps-bankroll"
				/> or sensing a cold table, exiting at the right moment is a skill as important as any.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				In the following section, we'll explore the psychology and strategy behind exiting the game.
				We'll discuss how to set flexible yet firm goals, how to read the room, and even how to deal
				with subpar dealers. Your success at Craps doesn't just depend on how you play; it's also
				about how you leave.

				Many players know their limits when it comes to losses, but surprisingly, when asked, “How
				much do you want to win?”, most respond with, “I don’t know.” It kills me. You need to think
				of a number. Entering a casino without a number is like sailing without a compass. Think
				about something you'd like to buy, and aim to have the casino cover the cost. This not only
				gives you direction but also a tangible reward to strive for.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Next is to have the willpower to leave when you reach your goal. You should consider the
				money involved in your goal includes the money on the table. Too many players only look at
				the money in the rail when assessing the situation. You need to add what you have in the
				rail to what you have on <Link text="the layout" href="the-craps-table" /> to get your true total.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Your goal is adjustable. You can move your goal higher but make sure to create stops,
				amounts you’re willing to go down to so you still leave with your intended target. People
				usually make their previous goal their new stop.
			</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p>
				You approach the table armed with $300, picturing those $200 (discount warehouse) Jimmy Choo
				heels your wife's been admiring. The magic number? $500. But the dice are rolling hot, and
				now the idea of a Gucci jacket for yourself enters the picture. You decide to push your
				limit to $750. However, going below $500 isn't an option; securing those heels for your wife
				is a must. Stick to this game plan, and both of you might be flaunting a new wardrobe soon.

			<p class="pb-4">
				If you’re not trying to make some moves on the dark side, you can’t beat a cold table. I’ve
				watched players pull out cash over and over and get wrecked. They think they can buy
				themselves out of it but can’t. Sometimes they’ll make a decent portion of it back, but
				usually never enough to make up for the losses.
			</p>
			<p>
				How do you know a table is cold? You don’t need to count your money or even look at it.
				You’ll realize you keep taking cheques out of the rail, and nothing is coming in. You look
				around and none of the other players have cheques. There is no excitement because it’s hard
				to be excited about losing money. This may be the time to go.

		<BlogH2 id="greatRoll" title="Right After a Great Roll">
			<p class="pb-4">
				I consider <Link text="a great roll" href="a-great-craps-roll" /> to be around 30 min? Give or
				take. It’s not a monster roll of like 45min-1hr+ but a long period of time where everyone is
				perpetually being paid. Lots of Place bets and Pass Line’s being paid repeatedly. A great roll
				can be 10 min if there are only a handful of players and the dice move fast the whole time. It
				can be less time if the stickperson doesn’t ever stop moving the dice.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s painful to watch players lose their money back after a great roll. Sure, the table may
				continue to do well, what my friend Marty would call “The Smolder,” but more often than not,
				the table goes back to normal. Up and down, over and over.

			<p class="pb-4">
				Casinos are often filled with a variety of players, some of whom can be obnoxious, loud,
				drunk, and outright rude. The list goes on. These <Link
					text="horrible players"
					href="not-to-do-at-craps"
				/> can appear without warning and, unfortunately, can stick around indefinitely. While most of
				their antics might be tolerated as long as they aren't breaking any rules, the dealers are often
				left helpless. They can try to handle the disruptions, but they can't fully control those players
				and are left shaking their head.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the players, there's always an option to walk away. One player is enough to ruin a Craps
				game, and you go to the casino to have fun, not put up with nonsense.

		<BlogH2 id="badDealers" title="If the Dealers Are No Good">
			<p class="pb-4">
				Unfortunately, you're bound to encounter a number of dealers who are less than stellar. It
				quickly becomes evident they are stumbling through the process. Doing things like fumbling
				cheques, taking too long to pay bets, paying bets wrong, setting up bets incorrectly, or
				doing things out of order. While many of these dealers might be novices, some just never
				seem to master the game despite years of experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given Craps has <Link text="a crew" href="the-crew" />, you can feel a little comforted
				knowing this sub-par dealer is being watched by another dealer, the box, and sometimes the
				floor supervisor. If they are left to fend for themselves, you’re in trouble. This is your
				cue to find another dealer. It could be another table, the opposite end of your current
				table, or, if things are really bad, you can wait for the next shift to arrive.

		<BlogH2 id="walkedUp" title="When You've Just Walked Up">
			<p class="pb-4">
				Upon stepping up to a Craps table, your immediate thought might not be to walk away. But
				before you drop your money on the table, it's worth taking a moment to read the room.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				You’re going to want to scan the rails. Are they they filled with cheques? The players are
				doing well. Are the rails empty? It means players players are losing. You’ll wan’t to listen
				for subtle hints in their tones or comments like, “The table's turned” or “Might be time for
				a break.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at the other players’ faces. Get a feeling for what kind of emotions they are going
				through. Are they looking dejected? Is everybody shaking their heads? Are dealers exchanging
				concerned glances? Keep in mind, players in the midst of a winning streak tend to radiate
				confidence which you should be able to pick up on. If that’s what you feel, you may want to
				stick around.

				You might face a dilemma when trying to leave the table but are waiting for something.
				Whatever it is, even if it’s something that will only take one min, you should never buy
				back in while you wait. It too often leads to disaster.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Waiting for your drink - </span>This is the number one way players end up buying
					back into the game. You might have waited the whole time for this drink, but there is
					another drink somewhere else you can buy if you really want one. If you buy back in, that
					$10 or $20 drink may turn into a $100 or $200 or $2,000 drink.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Waiting for your card - </span>You can always get another card. If the person who
					has it is busy, you don’t know when they are coming back, so you wait, and wait, then <Link
						text="buy
					in"
						href="the-stages"
					/> again, and they got ya!
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Waiting for your Uber - </span>Just because you have 8min before your driver arrives
					doesn’t mean you should start pulling money out of your pockets. This is your time to find
					a bench and start winding down. Reflect on the night.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Waiting to see the next roll - </span>The “next” syndrome. It’s in all the games.
					After finishing playing, you say to yourself, “I have to see the next roll,” “… the next
					spin,” “… the next hand.” You were done. You colored up. The cheques were put away. You
					had stepped away from the table. You even started walking away, but you had to turn
					around. You needed to validate your thoughts. The truth is you don’t need to know. It’s
					better not knowing. Tomorrow is another day.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The hit and run. Come up to a table, win a bunch of money real quick, then leave. Wham, bam,
				thank you, ma’am. Of course this only applies to those who are in it for the money. For
				those who are in it to enjoy the game, now you can enjoy it for longer.

				Knowing when to leave a Craps table involves much more than hitting a financial goal. It's
				about reading the table, <Link
					text="assessing the other players"
					href="first-time-player"
				/>, and understanding the risks of staying longer. Remember, the longer you linger, the more
				you stand to lose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider this a great time to go shopping. Maybe grab something to eat or take a nap in the
				room. Whatever you do, don’t try to force anything. The challenge lies in being mindful of
				the signs and recognizing when it's time to walk away, ensuring you leave with your dignity,
				and hopefully your wallet, intact.
