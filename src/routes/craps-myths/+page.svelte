				From the gambler's fallacy to the belief that the game is inherently rigged, Craps myths
				have been around at the tables for the longest time. Our goal here is to break down those
				myths, separating fact from fiction.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				By talking about the truths behind each myth, we offer a better understanding of Craps,
				allowing you to approach the game with extra knowledge and confidence. This article is not
				just about debunking myths, it’s also about building resistance from the stories you’ll hear
				at the tables.

		<BlogH2 id="gamblersFallacy" title="The Gamblers Fallacy">
			<p class="pb-4">
				The gambler's fallacy is that previous outcomes in a game of chance influence future
				results. In Craps, it’s when players believe that previous rolls of dice influence the
				likelihood of future rolls. This isn’t true because each roll of the dice is independent,
				and <Link text="the dice" href="the-dice" /> have no memory of past rolls. The odds of rolling
				any specific number are always the same on each roll, regardless of what numbers have or haven't
				appeared recently.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="riggedGame" title="The Game is Rigged">
			<p class="pb-4">
				Since all of the games in the casino are designed to have <Link
					text="an edge"
					href="rank-of-craps-bets"
				/> over the player, the casino doesn’t need to fix anything to make money. All they need to do
				is offer the option to play; over time, the casino will make more money than they ever lose.
				Therefore, the casino's profitability is inherently built into the games, making sure they win
				in the long run.

		<BlogH2 id="dealersRight" title="The Dealers Always Know What They Are Doing">
			<p class="pb-4">
				I have to be honest when I say that not all dealers know what they are doing. Like most
				people who start a profession, you can’t expect everyone to be good at the job. There will
				always be a core set of <Link text="dealers" href="tipping-the-dealers" /> at the casino who
				will hold the fort down.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="houseWins" title="The House Always Wins">
			<p class="pb-4">
				The house does not always win. Over the long run, the casino should win more money than the
				players, but in the short run, which could be considered a single night, month, or year, the
				players can easily win more than the casino. It helps to know the proper strategies and
				stick to bets with a lower house edge, but even those who have no clue what they’re doing
				can win out of sheer luck.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="wantToLose" title="The Dealers Want the House to Win">
			<p class="pb-4">
				The dealers are rooting for the players to win. Dealing at a table where everyone is losing
				is no fun for anyone. I can crack jokes and make people smile but constantly taking your
				money… it’s disheartening. When you bring the house down not only does it provide riches for
				everyone including the dealers, but comes with loads of fun as well.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>

		<BlogH2 id="pumpsOxygen" title="The Casino Pumps in Oxygen">
			<p class="pb-4">
				The widespread myth that casinos pump oxygen to keep players alert and gambling longer has
				been around for decades. In reality, there are probably some legal and safety concerns
				there, and the casino employs other methods to keep you at the tables such as surrounding
				you with bright lights and sounds, removing clocks, and giving free drinks.

		<BlogH2 id="greatRolls" title="There Are Never Good Rolls After a Great Roll">
			<p class="pb-4">
				Many seasoned players recognize that a <Link text="strong roll" href="a-great-craps-roll" />
				is a rare occurrence, so extending that streak feels almost unreal. And while a large portion
				of the table will color up and leave immediately after it’s over, a select few will stay to see
				what else the table has to offer, and many times those returns are only piled upon.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<BlogH2 id="sevenOuts" title="The Superstitions Cause 7-Outs">
			<p class="pb-4">
				There will be countless instances where a 7-out coincides with various superstitions, such
				as <Link text="stick change" href="the-crew" />, the dice bouncing off the table, or someone
				mentioning 'seven.' This happens simply because both these instances happen all the time so
				they end up happening at the same time. As they say, ‘correlation does not imply
				causation.’; superstitions themselves have no bearing on the outcome of the dice.
			</p>
		</BlogH2>
		<Divider />
		<section aria-label="Closing paragraphs">
			<p>
				Knowing you don’t have to worry about these myths lets you play the game with a little more
				peace of mind. Forget about rigged games or <Link
					text="superstitions"
					href="craps-superstitions"
				/> and focus on having a good time. Even though the casino has a built-in edge, it doesn’t win
				every time, so at any moment you can walk away with a pocket full of cash.
