			Countless players ask about the BUY lammer. The ON and OFF lammers are self-explanatory on
			bets, but what is the BUY? Buy Bets are Place Bets that pay True Odds because you paid a
			commission.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4">
			Once your bet gets high enough, the dealers will BUY the bet for you. Like Place Bets, your
			BUY must be rolled before a 7 to win. If a 7 is rolled before the Place Bet you bought, then

		<p class="pb-4">
			The commission is money you pay to get paid True Odds on your Place Bets. True Odds are what a
			bet is supposed to get paid, a bet with no advantage for the casino. You must pay a 5%
			Commission on the cost of the bet. For every $20 you bet, you must pay $1 commission. If you
			bet $21, $22, $23â€¦ all the way up to $39, it would still cost $1. Once you get to $40, it
			would cost $2.
		</p>
		<Divider />
		<ContentHeaderTwo title="How Do You Bet the Buy Bet in a Craps Game?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Normally, when your bet gets to an amount that requires you to BUY it, the dealer will tell
			you to drop the required commission amount. You don't need to worry about doing the math. The
			dealer will do it for you, and all you need to do is make sure the dealer knows how much money
			you want and where.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4">
			When you make a Buy bet, you put your money in the COME and tell the dealer you want to <Quote
				text="Buy"
			/>
			whichever Point it is. You would also add in the commission to the bet. E.g., If you wanted to
			buy the 4 for $20, you would put the bet plus commission into the COME, then tell the dealer, <Quote
				text="I would
		like to 'buy' the 4 for $20."
			/>

		<ContentHeaderTwo title="What Does a Buy Bet Pay in Craps?" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Like many other bets on the table, you must bet Place Bets in certain increments, and they pay
			differently depending on which number you're betting. Once a Buy bet wins, you must pay the
			same commission to keep the bet up to win again. If you decide to take your Buy Bet down after
			it wins, you won't need to pay commission a second time.
		</p>
		<ContentHeaderThree title="Buying the 5, 6, 8, and 9" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			The difference from Place bet odds to true odds when buying the 5, 6, 8, or 9 are so small
			that the 5% commission you are paying could lose you money. Seasoned players will only buy the
			4 or 10.
		</p>
		<ContentHeaderThree title="Buying the 4 and 10" />
		<p class="pb-4">
			Buying the 4 or 10 is worth the cost of commission. $20 Buy on the 10 nets you $40 instead of
			$36. You get 4:1 on that dollar but must still pay another $1 vig to keep it up to win again.
			When you want to Buy the 4 and 10 simultaneously, the dealer will add up the total of the two
			bets to determine the commission. E.g., If you wanted to buy the 4 and 10 for $50 each, you
			would think, <Quote text="I need to pay $2 for the 4 and another $2 for the 10" />, but you
			don't think of them as separate bets. You have a total of $100 in action, which is $5
			commission.
		</p>
		<p class="pb-4">
			In this example, you Buy the 10 for $35 + $1 in commission. When it hits, it pays 2:1 or $70,
			but you must pay the $1 commission again.

		<p class="pb-4">
			In this example, you decide to Buy the 10 for $75, which is $3 vig. It wins $150 instead of
