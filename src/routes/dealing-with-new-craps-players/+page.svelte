				They say everyone was a beginner once, but in the world of craps, a newcomer's impact can
				range from a breath of fresh air to a full-blown tornado. Do you think a new player can't
				influence the game? Think again. Most of them are there for a good time, and that’s what we
				should strive to give them. Some of them are there for the money, so we wish them luck. Some
				could care less about the rest of us, so we don’t show mercy when the time comes.

			<p class="pb-4">
				Let's first talk about some Craps etiquette and how you can assist newbies in becoming a
				part of the community.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Be welcoming - </span>First impressions are everything. When a new player approaches
					the table, a warm “Hello” can go a long way. Introduce yourself and offer a smile. This
					simple gesture can set the stage for a friendly game.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Explain the basics - </span>Once the new player is comfortable, offer to explain the
					basic rules of the game. Keep it simple; you don't want to overwhelm them with jargon or
					complex strategies. Focus on the core concepts, such as the 'Pass Line' bet and what it
					means to 'shoot the dice.'
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Share the unwritten rules - </span>Craps has its fair share of unwritten rules. For
					example, it's considered taboo to <Link
						text="reach into the table"
						href="not-to-do-at-craps"
					/> when the shooter has the dice or to say the word “Seven” during the Intermediate Roll. Share
					these unwritten rules with the new player so they can avoid awkward situations and blend in
					with the regulars.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Offer some strategy tips - </span>If the new player seems interested, share some
					basic strategy tips. Explain the Odds and which bets are the better bets. Remember, the
					goal is to make the new player feel comfortable and confident, not to turn them into an
					instant expert.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Be Patient and Encouraging - </span>New players are bound to make mistakes. Whether
					they forget to place a bet or accidentally toss the dice awry, it's important to be
					patient. Offer constructive criticism if appropriate, but always be encouraging. Celebrate
					their wins and offer consolation for their losses.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Know when to step back - </span>While it's great to be helpful, it's also important
					to know when to step back. Some new players might prefer to learn the ropes through
					observation or by talking to the dealer. Respect their learning style and offer help only
					when it's wanted.
				</li>

		<BlogH2 id="playerBrings" title="What a New Player Brings to the Table">
			<p class="pb-4">
				From bringing undeniable energy, and offering a fresh perspective of hope, to flipping a
				losing streak on its head, the impact of a new player is both exciting and transformative.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>A fresh burst of energy - </span>You know someone whose energy can’t be contained –
					it’s that person who walks up to the game and begins to command the rest. They don’t allow
					dull, boring games; instead, they make sure everyone joins in the fun.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>A glimmer of hope - </span>Nothing is worse than having the dice go round and round
					with the same group of players, and all they do is lose. So when a new player comes up,
					they're that glimmer of hope, signaling brighter possibilities ahead.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>A touch of Lady Luck - </span>Sometimes that unexpected player joins, and the
					table's <Link text="fortune flips" href="craps-superstitions" />, changing a series of
					losses into a string of wins.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="pb-4">
				You can not put a limit on how many of the rules a new player will break and, one at a time,
				the other players and the dealers will tell the person what they’re doing wrong. Many things
				won’t affect the roll, but the following are some of the worst.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Mid-roll buy-in - </span>Players often won’t know they shouldn’t buy into the middle
					of a roll. Stopping the game so they can get their money can stifle a hot roll.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Saying 7 repeatedly - </span>Many players know the number 7 has something to do with
					the game but don’t know when it’s good or bad, so they will repeatedly mention it during
					the intermediate roll. For those superstitious, this can evoke the 7.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Reaching into the table - </span>New players don’t know they are allowed verbal bets
					and will try to beat the throw of the dice by reaching into the table and making a
					last-second bet. It can be over for the whole table if they get hit with the dice.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Pointing - </span>There is so much on the table that they are almost forced to use
					their hands to explain what they need to be explained. If they aren’t the ones pointing,
					then the friend teaching them will be the one pointing. Either way, the shooter has to
					watch these fingers try and produce a symphony with the layout when they must be focused
					on shooting the dice. It can end in tragedy.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Unpredictable dice throws - </span><Link text="The dice" href="the-dice" /> in Craps
					are surprisingly sharp, and believe me, they can leave a mark. First-time shooters, unfamiliar
					with the correct angles and release techniques, might accidentally toss them in ways that could
					lead to other players getting nicked. It's essential to pay attention and be cautious of those
					players.

		<BlogH2 id="worstPlayers" title="The Worst Types of New Players">
			<p class="pb-4">
				While many players can learn from their mistakes, other players choose to stay ignorant
				which can kill the vibe at the table. Keep an eye out for these players and don’t be afraid
				to find another table if you find you’re not having fun anymore.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>Players that refuse to listen - </span>There are a lot of people who don’t like
					being told what to do. Some will do things on purpose to get under our skin. Others will
					say things they know they know they shouldn’t. It’s best to ask the dealers to try and do
					something about it.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Drunk Players - </span>People who are overly intoxicated are some of the worst
					players to deal with. They don’t remember any of the rules you are telling them, make the
					same mistakes we’ve repeatedly yelled at them for, and decide to talk loudly to everyone
					at the table. Sometimes it’s entertaining, but mostly it’s just a pain.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Pretend know-it-alls - </span>These players won’t necessarily do anything to anyone
					in particular but know trying to help them will most likely be a waste of time.

				Being an <Link text="experienced Craps player" href="craps-order-of-operation" /> comes with
				its own set of responsibilities, one of which is helping new players understand the game. You
				have to use a balancing act of patience and guidance, and not let it bother you when they make
				mistakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember that none of us is perfect, therefore none of us have room to talk. By being
				welcoming, sharing knowledge, and offering encouragement, you can help make the Craps table
				a more enjoyable place for everyone involved.
